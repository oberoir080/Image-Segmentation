# Image-Segmentation
The "Code.py" segments the image via the pixels dataset that is stored in the "img_flat" array. The image can be changed to any other image. If a different image is to be used change the img variable from "peppers.png" to the new image file name. (For example if the new image file name is "fruits.png" change the sixth line of code to img = cv2.imread('fruits.png'))
